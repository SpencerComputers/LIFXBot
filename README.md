# LIFXBot
ðŸ’¡ - Control your smart lights via a Discord bot

### Required Dependencies
* Discord.py Nodule v1.0 or later
* Python v3.0 or later
* Requests Module

## Setup
To set this up, you will need to generate a LIFX Cloud token and create a bot. If you do not know how to do this, you simply are not advanced enough to use this bot, however if you really want to give it a crack, look at [this guide](https://github.com/SpencerComputers/Rainbot/blob/master/github_stuff/tutorial.md) on how to make a discord bot. To create a LIFX token, go to [LIFX Cloud](https://cloud.lifx.com/sign_in) and sign in with your LIFX account. Click **Generate new token** and give it a name, then click **Generate**. Now copy the token's and place them in their respective fields in the `main.py` file.
